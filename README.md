# DIO-Project-CreateWallet
## The idea of this project is to create a wallet using the testnet for better understanding the dynamic and also how the transactions work in practice.
In this project, we'll develop a Bitcoin wallet generator that utilizes public and private key pairs. The goal is to create a generator that produces deposit and withdrawal addresses for the generated wallet. Additionally, we'll import this wallet into Electrum, a desktop application used for sending and receiving Bitcoin transactions. Finally, we'll execute a cryptocurrency transfer using the created wallet.
